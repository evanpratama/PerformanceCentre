Dear Sir:

I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you for assistance in resolving a matter. You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving funds of US$40,000,000 out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.
 
Yours truly,

Prince Alyusi Islassis
